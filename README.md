# Manchester United Analysis Project
As a lifelong Manchester United fan, it has pained me to witness the club's downfall since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure. Through this project, I will diagnose, study, and analyze England's greatest football clubs trajectory since 2014, in order to ask some crucial questions, such as:
1. How did Manchester United players' FIFA ratings (ability/potential) compare to those of other top flight clubs that have been successful in the past decade (Chelsea, Manchester City, Leicester City, and Liverpool)?
2. How did Manchester United's average league position change throughout seasons?
3. How much does players' transfer market value affect the team's performance?

Datasets and other information will be scraped mainly from Kaggle, Optasoccer, Wikipedia, and Whoscored.
